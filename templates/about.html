                <h3>What is Veriscope?</h3>
                <p>
                    Veriscope is a specialized malware analysis and detection engineering platform designed for security analysts,
                    threat hunters, and SOC teams. It automates the tedious, time-consuming process of transforming raw malware
                    artifacts into actionable detection rules and threat intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional malware analysis workflows require analysts to manually extract strings, identify indicators of
                    compromise, research MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and hand-craft detection rules for YARA and SIEM platforms.
                    This process can take hours or even days per sample. Veriscope compresses this entire workflow into a single
                    automated pipeline, delivering comprehensive analysis results in seconds.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern malware increasingly relies on sophisticated obfuscation techniques—Base64 encoding (standard, URL-safe/JWT),
                    GZIP/zlib/bzip2 compression, hexadecimal encoding, ASCII85/Base32 variants, binary string encoding, JavaScript escapes
                    (\xHH, \uXXXX), repeating-key XOR ciphers, ROT13/Caesar ciphers, URL encoding, PowerShell UTF-16LE obfuscation, and
                    complex multi-layer encoding chains (often 6+ layers deep). Analysts waste valuable time manually decoding these
                    layers before they can even begin their investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once decoded, extracting actionable IOCs (URLs, IP addresses, domains, registry keys, mutex names, file paths,
                    cryptocurrency addresses) requires pattern matching expertise and careful validation. Mapping these behaviors to
                    MITRE ATT&CK techniques demands deep framework knowledge. Finally, writing production-ready YARA and Sigma rules
                    requires specialized syntax knowledge and careful testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Veriscope eliminates these bottlenecks by automating the entire chain: advanced multi-layer deobfuscation →
                    IOC extraction → ATT&CK mapping → rule generation.
                </p>

                        <h4>Advanced Multi-Layer Deobfuscation</h4>
                        <p>20 specialized decoders automatically unwrap up to 6 layers of nested obfuscation including: Base64 (standard,
                        PowerShell UTF-16LE, URL-safe/JWT), GZIP/zlib/bzip2 compression with magic byte detection, hexadecimal encoding,
                        ASCII85/Base32 variants, binary strings (01010100...), JavaScript escapes (\xHH, \uXXXX), ROT13/Caesar cipher,
                        URL encoding, and advanced XOR cryptanalysis (position-based repeating-key breaking, crib-dragging attacks, common
                        key dictionary). Features SHA1 cycle detection, per-string timeout (2s), automatic plaintext markers, and detailed
                        audit trails.</p>

                        and animated decode chains (e.g., "base64 → hex → rot13"). Conservative heuristics with strict can_decode() validation
                        prevent false positives. Early termination on success. Configurable via DeobfuscationConfig API: max depth (6 default),
                        timeout (30s), XOR enable/disable, custom progress callbacks.</p>
