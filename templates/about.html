                <h3>What is Veriscope?</h3>
                <p>
                    Veriscope is a specialized malware analysis and detection engineering platform designed for security analysts,
                    threat hunters, and SOC teams. It automates the tedious, time-consuming process of transforming raw malware
                    artifacts into actionable detection rules and threat intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional malware analysis workflows require analysts to manually extract strings, identify indicators of
                    compromise, research MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and hand-craft detection rules for YARA and SIEM platforms.
                    This process can take hours or even days per sample. Veriscope compresses this entire workflow into a single
                    automated pipeline, delivering comprehensive analysis results in seconds.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern malware increasingly relies on sophisticated obfuscation techniques—Base64 encoding (standard, URL-safe/JWT),
                    GZIP/zlib/bzip2 compression, hexadecimal encoding, ASCII85/Base32 variants, binary string encoding, JavaScript escapes
                    (\xHH, \uXXXX), repeating-key XOR ciphers, ROT13/Caesar ciphers, URL encoding, PowerShell UTF-16LE obfuscation, and
                    complex multi-layer encoding chains (often 6+ layers deep). Analysts waste valuable time manually decoding these
                    layers before they can even begin their investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once decoded, extracting actionable IOCs (URLs, IP addresses, domains, registry keys, mutex names, file paths,
                    cryptocurrency addresses) requires pattern matching expertise and careful validation. Mapping these behaviors to
                    MITRE ATT&CK techniques demands deep framework knowledge. Finally, writing production-ready YARA and Sigma rules
                    requires specialized syntax knowledge and careful testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Veriscope eliminates these bottlenecks by automating the entire chain: advanced multi-layer deobfuscation →
                    IOC extraction → ATT&CK mapping → rule generation.
                </p>

                        <h4>Advanced Multi-Layer Deobfuscation</h4>
                        <p>27 specialized decoders unwrap up to 6 layers of nested obfuscation: Base64 (standard, PowerShell UTF-16LE, URL-safe),
                        GZIP/zlib/bzip2 compression, hexadecimal (with noise filtering), string reversal (detects reversed base64), ROT13/Caesar
                        with 45+ malware keywords, URL encoding, JSON/JavaScript extractors, character codes (decimal/hex formats), HTML entities,
                        and multi-byte XOR (0xDEAD, 0xDEADBEEF, 0xCAFEBABE + common keys). Advanced features: SHA1 cycle detection, quality regression
                        prevention, per-string timeout (2s), automatic plaintext detection, and comprehensive audit trails with layer-by-layer quality scoring.</p>

                        <p>Intelligent quality regression detection prevents over-decoding by tracking quality scores at each layer and selecting
                        the best intermediate result. Automatic preset rotation tries multiple configurations (balanced → malware_analysis → aggressive →
                        deepseek_optimized) when default fails. Real-time progress with Server-Sent Events displays animated decode chains. Optimized
                        decoder ordering: Extractors → String transforms → URL → ROT13 → Base64 → Compression → Multi-byte XOR → Single-byte XOR.
                        Configurable presets, timeouts, and XOR settings. Handles short strings, security keywords, and complex encoding chains with 80% test accuracy.</p>

                    human review, tuning, and validation before deployment in production environments. Always test rules in a
