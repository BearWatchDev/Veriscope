            <div class="about-section">
                <h3>What is Veriscope?</h3>
                <p>
                    Veriscope is a specialized malware analysis and detection engineering platform designed for security analysts,
                    threat hunters, and SOC teams. It automates the tedious, time-consuming process of transforming raw malware
                    artifacts into actionable detection rules and threat intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional malware analysis workflows require analysts to manually extract strings, identify indicators of
                    compromise, research MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and hand-craft detection rules for YARA and SIEM platforms.
                    This process can take hours or even days per sample. Veriscope compresses this entire workflow into a single
                    automated pipeline, delivering comprehensive analysis results in seconds.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern malware increasingly relies on obfuscation techniques—Base64 encoding, hexadecimal encoding, URL encoding,
                    PowerShell obfuscation, and multi-layer encoding chains. Analysts waste valuable time manually decoding these
                    layers before they can even begin their investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once decoded, extracting actionable IOCs (URLs, IP addresses, domains, registry keys, mutex names, file paths,
                    cryptocurrency addresses) requires pattern matching expertise and careful validation. Mapping these behaviors to
                    MITRE ATT&CK techniques demands deep framework knowledge. Finally, writing production-ready YARA and Sigma rules
                    requires specialized syntax knowledge and careful testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Veriscope eliminates these bottlenecks by automating the entire chain: deobfuscation → IOC extraction →
                    ATT&CK mapping → rule generation.
                </p>

                    <h4>Static Analysis Only</h4>
                    <p>Veriscope performs static text-based analysis exclusively. It does NOT execute binaries, run sandboxed
                    environments, or perform dynamic analysis. All operations are read-only and safe for production analyst workstations.</p>

                    <h4>Detection Rules are Templates</h4>
                    <p>Generated YARA and Sigma rules are TEMPLATES designed to accelerate detection engineering. They require
                    human review, tuning, and validation before deployment in production environments. Always test rules in a
                    controlled environment first to avoid false positives.</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>ATT&CK Mapping Limitations</h4>
                    <p>Technique mappings are heuristic-based and derived from keyword matching and pattern detection. They are NOT
                    definitive behavioral analysis. Always correlate with additional threat intelligence, sandbox reports, and manual
                    analysis before making attribution decisions.</p>
